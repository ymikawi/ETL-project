# ETL-Project
This project required us to extract data from a website,transform it into a Dataframe and or visualizations that makes it easy to understand 
and load it into a database.

The first data was derived from scraping Zillow's Home listing data. I filtered it to Single Family Homes in the City limits of Alexandria 
Virginia. 

The second data was imported from the US Department of Education website. I pulled information on both public and private schools within the 
City limits of Alexandria Virginia for families trying to move into Alexandria Virginia.

I chose to use a relational database which resulted in me uploading the final data to Amazon Web services and keeping another dataset in my local 
MySQL database.
